- Full Stack Deep Learning materials - https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/
- Made With ML "MLOps" series - https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/
- Mikes Males's Sound Classification project - https://mikesmales.medium.com/sound-classification-using-deep-learning-8bc2aa1990b7
- Fast.ai's course & library - https://docs.fast.ai/

Implementation was done using Jupytext, to allow the comfort of working with notebooks.
